- Main & Management (Typical management, only need managers, no systems)
- Pool (Custom delegate to instantiate instances automatically, standard methodology)
- State Machine (Listener support)
- Billboard (Face enemies towards camera at all times
- Camera : Movement (for transition at beginning) and Rotation (controlled by mouse)
- Score (Display on canvas UI)
- Game state (Menu / Game / Death screen / POSSIBLY: Highscore screen)
- Enemy spawning (Multi-pooled, bonus rounds for special enemies like knuckles)
- Projectiles, enemy and player
- Player vitals (Health, special attack charge?)
- Enemy drop-pods (Model/Image needed)
- Enemies (Model/Images for all enemies)
- Pathing (Do enemies just look at centre and move to it?)
- Level geometry (Flat-earth model)
- Highscores (Save/Load from player prefs)
- Minimap (Based on canvas with blips for enemies pulled from enemy management system)
- UI (3 OR 4 canvases, Menu, Game, Death screen. Manager toggles them on and off based upon game state. May need 4th for generic highscore display)

Menu:
- Play
- Highscore? If enough time
- Exit

Death:
- Score
- Highscore? If enough time

NOTES:
- Use a single scene with canvases which appears/disappear.
- Management system auto-cleans and spawns upon game state change.
